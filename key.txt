Structure:
  Below the JS directory, namespaces follow the folder structure (Except for plugins).


Folders/namespaces starting with '_':
  The contents should not be directly accessed and should go via the parent class of the same name

Filenames starting with '-':
  Files exporting a single function in the namespace of the folder that contains it

Filenames starting with '+':
  Files exporting a single class in the namespace of the folder that contains it.
  If extending a class, the directory of the parent folder will include the parent class.
  The parent class name will be the singular form of the folder name (parts/part)

Filenames starting with '~':
  Files with their own namespace which may export multiple functions or variables
  These are only used in special cases (such as event handling)

Filenames starting with '++':
  Typescript interface files which define types to be used elsewhere
  These can mostly be ignored and they have no JS equivalent
